# NBA-Home-Court-Advantage
Trying to determine what factors influence home court advantage for NBA teams.

In this file, I start by looking at which NBA team held the best record during two different seasons. 
Then I start trying to determine if "home court advantage" is a real phenomenon or not. And, I was able to conclude that it is real using 'bootstrapping'.
Then, after determining that "home court advantage" is real, I used my intution regarding sports to try to determine what the main factor contributing to "home court advantage" is.

Overall, I was able to determine that "home court advantage" is likely due to the fact that NBA teams tend to get more rebounds when they play at home vs. away.
